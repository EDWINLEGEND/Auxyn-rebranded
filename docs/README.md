# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation and reference files.

## Files

### `deployment.md`
Contains deployment instructions and configuration details for various platforms.

- Deployment strategies
- Environment setup

- Hosting platform specifics

### `index.html`
Legacy HTML file that may have been used for prototyping or testing purposes.

**Note:** This file is not needed for the Next.js application as Next.js handles HTML generation automatically.
